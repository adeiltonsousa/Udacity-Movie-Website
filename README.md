Website para atividade - Cursos Udacity

Instruções

    Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
    Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
    To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py. This module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
    Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
