Website para atividade - Cursos Udacity




Instruções

   <p>Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.</p>
    <p>Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.</p>
    <p>To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py. This module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.</p>
    <p>Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.</p>
